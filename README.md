# Critical Spacetime Crystals

This repository accompanies the paper *“Critical spacetime crystals in continuous dimensions”* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.xxxxx).

It contains the data files and plotting scripts (`plotsCSC.ipynb`, `plots.nb`) used to reproduce the figures presented in the paper.

A numerical code for computing critical spacetime crystals and their echoing periods, written by Tobias Jechtl as part of his master’s thesis, is available at https://github.com/tobjec/parallel-critical-collapse.
