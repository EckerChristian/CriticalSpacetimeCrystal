# Critical Spacetime Crystals

This repository accompanies the paper *“Critical spacetime crystals in continuous dimensions”* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.xxxxx).

It contains the data files and plotting script (`plots/plots.ipynb`) used to reproduce the figures presented in the paper.

The directory "code" contains a modified version of the code used to compute the echoing period (delta) and the critical exponent (gamma). The original implementation was developed by Jose M. Martin-Garcia and Carsten Gundlach in the work published as Phys.Rev. D68 (2003) 024011 (https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0304070). For the purpose of this work it was generalized to arbitrary spacetime dimensions by Florian Ecker with support from Carsten Gundlach.
For earlier implementations of the D=4 case see also https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.3214 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-019-03413-8.

A numerical code for computing critical spacetime crystals and their echoing periods, written by Tobias Jechtl as part of his master’s thesis, is available at https://github.com/tobjec/parallel-critical-collapse.
