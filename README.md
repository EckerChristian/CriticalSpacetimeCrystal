# Critical Spacetime Crystals

This repository accompanies the paper *“Critical spacetime crystals in continuous dimensions”* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.xxxxx).

It contains the data files and plotting script (`plots/plots.ipynb`) used to reproduce the figures presented in the paper.

A numerical code for computing critical spacetime crystals and their echoing periods, written by Tobias Jechtl as part of his master’s thesis, is available at https://github.com/tobjec/parallel-critical-collapse.

The directory "code" contains a modified version of the code used to compute the echoing period and the critical exponent. The original implementation was developed by Jose M. Martin-Garcia and Carsten Gundlach in the work published as Phys.Rev. D68 (2003) 024011. For the purpose of this work it was generalized to arbitrary spacetime dimensions by Florian Ecker with support from Carsten Gundlach.
